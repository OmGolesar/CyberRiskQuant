    ## Welcome to CyberRiskQuant
    
    This tool helps you quantify cybersecurity risks in financial terms using the **Factor Analysis of Information Risk (FAIR)** model 
    and Monte Carlo simulations.
    
    ### What is FAIR?
    FAIR is a framework for understanding, analyzing, and measuring information risk. It provides a model for understanding the factors 
    that contribute to risk and how they affect each other.
    
    ### How to use this tool:
    1. Navigate to the **Risk Analysis** page to analyze your own risk scenarios
    2. Explore pre-built **Case Studies** to understand real-world applications
    3. Visit the **Educational Resources** page to learn more about GRC concepts
    
    ### Key Benefits:
    - Quantify cybersecurity risks in monetary terms
    - Make data-driven decisions about security investments
    - Communicate risk effectively to stakeholders
    - Prioritize security initiatives based on financial impact
